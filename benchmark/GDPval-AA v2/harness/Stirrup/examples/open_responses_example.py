"""Example using the OpenResponses API client.

Demonstrates using the OpenResponsesClient, which uses OpenAI's Responses API
(POST /v1/responses) instead of the Chat Completions API. This API is useful
for providers that implement the newer Responses API format.

The Responses API has some differences from Chat Completions:
- System messages are passed as `instructions` parameter (separate from input)
- Uses `input` instead of `messages`
- Tool calls use `call_id` instead of `tool_call_id`
- Supports reasoning models with `reasoning_effort` parameter
