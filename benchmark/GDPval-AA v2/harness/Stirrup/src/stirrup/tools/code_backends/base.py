    CodeExecToolProvider is a ToolProvider that manages code execution environments
    (sandboxes, containers, local temp directories) and returns a code_exec Tool.

    Subclasses must implement:
    - __aenter__(): Initialize environment and return the code_exec tool
    - __aexit__(): Cleanup the execution environment
    - run_command(): Execute a command and return raw result
    - read_file_bytes(): Read file content as bytes from the environment
    - write_file_bytes(): Write bytes to a file in the environment

    Default implementations are provided for:
    - save_output_files(): Save files to local dir or another exec env (uses primitives)
    - upload_files(): Upload files from local or another exec env (uses primitives)

    Overridable output-path hooks (see the extending docs for the contract):
    - output_source_roots(): Declare absolute roots for resolving output paths
    - resolve_output_source(): Resolve/reject a source before it is read
    - output_destination_identity(): Reject escapes and identify cross-env destinations

    All providers accept an optional allowlist of command patterns. With an
    allowlist, each command is parsed with shlex, matched against the patterns,
    and executed without a shell: arguments are passed literally, and shell
    syntax such as pipes, redirects, and expansions is rejected. Without an
    allowlist, all commands are allowed and run through a shell.
